# Overview

My note book looks at artist frequency based on the Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums of all time list. I also look at which generes appear most frequently on the Rolling Stone list. 

# Dataset

I love classic rock. I have strong opinions about the Rolling Stone Top 500 Album list. I think U2 sucks and shouldn't have 5 albums on there and that David Bowie deserves AT LEAST another 3 albums tacked on to the five that already made the list. 

Therefore I wanted to look at this data set with a less emotional and more analytical mindset and get some basic overall info out of it. 


# Running  the Code

The entire notebook can be run by clicking the "CELL" drop down menu from the Jupyter notebook and then clicking "RUN ALL" 
All graphs and the included CSV file should run properly. 

# Contributing

I decided not to edit the way rolling stone had classifed the albums by genre and subgenre but someone could maybe reduce the number of cross-listed categories to get a more generalized sense of the data. It would also be interesting to have some morre numberical data about the albums (like # of album copies sold) instead of just arbitrary rankings and frequency. I also wanted to make a chart that looked at which years were the most frequently represented (via a line chart). I reached out to two students for help on this project. Paxton Fitzpatrick and Kaitlyn Hahn. All other sources are cited directly in the assignment notebook.
