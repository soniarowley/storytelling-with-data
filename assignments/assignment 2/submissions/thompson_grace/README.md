### Overview

In this notebook, I explored student attendances. I used data analysis to find patterns between gender, number of excused absences, and special needs to see if special needs influenced the rate of absence differently for each gender. I also wanted to see if those with special needs had more excused absences than those without.


### Dataset

I chose to analyze a dataset that gathered school attendance records to understand absence patterns. The original dataset included age, sex, grade, as well as disadvantaged and special needs to compare to absences. The dataset is called "school_absences" and I retrieved the it from the jupyter Psych81.09 "data-stories" folder in Jupyter. 

### Running the Code

For my notebook to run, it needs to have numpy and pandas imported for wrangling data. To visualize the data, seaborn, hypertools and plotly_express libraries need to be imported as well. Push shift and enter to run each section. 

### Contributing

One area of the notebook that could be cleaned up is the special needs codes. There were two different special needs codes which I did not understand but assumed to be indicators that the person had some classification of a special need. Other people could build on my work by exploring trends for unexcused absences, for example, they could see if people with special needs also had more unexcused absences than those without, or see if people with more excused absences also had more unexcused absences.   
On this project, I looked to the data_wrangling_with_pandas notebook, and the data_visualization notebook. I also recieved help from Professor Jeremy Manning on importing the data into my notebook, and matplotlib for more help.
