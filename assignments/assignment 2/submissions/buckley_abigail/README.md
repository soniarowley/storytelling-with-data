# Overview

I analyzed a dataset on happiness, reading the csv file and creating a pandas dataframe. From there I cleaned up the dataset by removing NaN values and irrelevant columns and recasting ordinal data as numerical data so that I could better graph and execute calculations. I also made some simple plots from both the dataframe and an extracted numpy array.

# Downloading the dataset

I used a subset of the General Social Survey (https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/trends/Gender%20&%20Marriage?measure=happy) concerned with happiness of various individuals along with other relevant information such as age, hours of sleep, income, and job satisfaction.

# Running the code

The cells in the notebook should be run in order. Generally, each cell executes a different general operation, such as one cell for data cleansing and another for plotting.

This notebook must also be run in its current directory (filepath Psych81.09/course/abuckley/storytelling-with-data/assignments/assignment%202/submissions/buckley_abigail/buckley_abigail.ipynb) in order to properly retrieve the happiness dataset from the happiness folder in the data_stories directory. 

# Contributing to the code

Others can contribute to this project by creating more plots using the dataframe, particularly ones using columns that I have either eliminated or have not yet visualized in this notebook.
