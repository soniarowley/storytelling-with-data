## Overview
The purpose of this notebook is to take a CSV data file, clean it up using a pandas dataframe, and create some simple visualizations as a means of high-level summarization. A multidimentional plot was created using hypertools to see if any patterns may exist in the data, and then a scatterplot was created using seaborn to visualize one such pattern.

## Dataset
The dataset provides estimates of MLB All-Star teams from the seasons between 1933 and 2015, and provides information such as the offensive / defensive talent of each team. It can be found at [FiveThirtyEight's GitHub repo.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/mlb-allstar-teams)

## Running the code
Download the allstar_team_talent.csv file from the link above into the same directory as the Python notebook yang_richard.ipynb, and run each cell in succession.

## Contributing
Those interested in making contributions to this notebook should feel free to examine other possible trends and patterns in this data, and show them in more complex, definitive, and / or more aesthetically pleasing visualizations. And a thank you to FiveThirtyEight for creating this neat dataset.
