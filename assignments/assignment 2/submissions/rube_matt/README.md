# Overview

My analyses were designed to understand weather trends over the course of one year in NYC. Mainly, attempting to understand how predictive averages differed from the actual temperatures found daily throughout one calendar year, as well as correlations between season, temperature, and precipitation amounts. The 3d scatterplot was helpful for visualizing the difference between average and actual mean temperatures on a day to day basis, as well as how precipitation changed throughout the year. The standard deviation analysis on the numpy array helped to show how extreme New York's temperature fluctuations could be throughout the year, with 18 degrees (the result) indicating fairly mild fluctuations for the majority of the year.

# Dataset

My dataset was pulled from fivethirtyeights database of various datasets to work with. The set I worked with was a cleaned csv of temperatures pulled from weatherunderground.com for New York City over the course of one year from July 2014 to July 2015.

# Running the code
For running the code, simply start from the top and run each input cell in order from top to bottom. That will ensure the proper adjustments are made to the datasets prior to each visual analysis. 

# Contributing
The first major contribution that could occur would be to convert the timestamp dates data in the numpy array at the bottom of the notebook into something cleaner and more sortable, so that further analysis could be done on the data to understand weather correlations by date/season. Secondly, a fantastic extension to this project would be more up to date dates from weatherunderground for the same region (NYC) to see if comparatively, NYC weather has remained consistent or has differed significantly since 2014. Another cool extension would be to take these same analyses, but using a self-created csv for Hanover's weather data from this past year (or from 2014-2015 for a more direct comparison). Fivethirtyeight has instructions for downloading and parsing the relevant data from weatherunderground.
