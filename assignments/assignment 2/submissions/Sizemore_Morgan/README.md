# Overview
My assignment two notebook allowed me to test out different data wrangling and visualization strategies. The point of my code/analyses was to try to identify relationships or patterns among the traits seen in US Supreme Court Justices. 

# Dataset
I chose to use a data set from Professor Lee Epstein's Supreme Court Database. This data base offers data on over 240 characteristics, for every past and present justice. These characteristics range from traits such as gender and age to name of law school. 
I chose to drop many of the traits and focus on nomination year, whether or not a justice became chief justice, birth year, race, gender, undergraduate school, and law school.

# Running the Code
The code should be run cell by cell. Users can manually change the traits that they choose to have displayed in the data frame and in subsequent visualizations by adding/removing traits in the justices_data.drop command, and then continuing to run the cells. 

# Collaborations 
    # Future Ideas
    Future collaborators could clean up the drop function. Ideally, this function would be inclusive rather than exclusive (selecting the traits to keep in the data frame, rather than list the traits to drop). 
    Future analyses could look at how traits have varied in clusters of judges serving together, over time.
