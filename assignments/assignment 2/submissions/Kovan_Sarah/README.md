# Overview

The purpose of this data analysis is to gain a better understanding of popular candies sold in stores and distributed to children on Halloween. The dataset described 85 popular candies based on their flavor profiles, popularity (i.e. % wins in a faceoff against other candies), form, and sugar and price percentiles at the time the data was collected. The candies' sugar pecentiles were plotted against their price percentiles and against their popularity (win %) in order to help parents choose the healthiest, most cost effective candy choices for their children.

The dataset contains information about 85 varieties of candy. It notes whether or not the candies possess the following components: chocolate, fruit flavor, caramel, nuts, nougat, crisped rice wafer, what form the candies are in (hard, bar, or pluribus), the percentage of faceoffs against other candies they won, and their sugar and price percentiles.

# Running the Code

Before running the code, make sure that the dataset is downloaded into your folder under the name 'candypowerranking.csv'.

To add to this data analysis, data scientists might consider looking for which flavor components, if any, seem to correlate with higher sugar or price percentiles. They might also consider comparing the win percents of various combinations of flavor components (e.g. caramel, nougat) in order to determine which combinations tend to be best-liked. Within specific flavor combinations, they might compare sugar percentiles to look for lower-sugar alternatives to similar candies with high sugar percentiles.
