## Overview -  write a few sentences about what you did in your notebook (e.g. what was the "point" of the analyses you ran)

This analysis looked at trends in how people of different religions feel comfortable:
 * (1) telling people they'll pray for them
 * (2) asking about
 * (3) bringing up religion unprompted. 
The original survey contained a number of questions and many answers were in the form of ordinal data. After cleaning up the data and converting it to numerical equivalents, I created a section of three bar plots looking at the frequency of 1, 2, and 3. In addition, I created a visualization of the data colored by Household Income and looked at an array of high income individuals.

## Dataset 

source: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/religion-survey

The survey covers numerous questions related to a person's religious behaviors and attitudes, as well as demographic data. 

## Running the code 

Run the cells sequentially in aly_berger.ipynb. Assuming nothing has been changed and `religion-survey-results.csv` is in the same folder as `aly_berger.ipynb`, there is nothing else needed for running the code.

### Contributing 

Sources of inspiration are noted throughout the cells right above the inspired code. Although I selected for a small portion of the original survey, one could examine different questions or different attitudes by not dropping those relevant columns. Additionally, more complex demographic analyses could be performed to obtain a better understanding of the key characteristics influencing religious behaviors and attitudes.
