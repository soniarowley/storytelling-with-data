# Overview

I analyzed NCAA March Madness forecasts from 2018. The existing data set looked at how likely each team was to advance in the tournament on a given day. I wanted to look at the relationship between predictions of round wins and the teams' existing rankings to further understand how people make informed/uninformed forecasts.

The dataset forecasts how likely both mens' and womens' teams are to advance on each day of the NCAA tournament in each round. It also incorporates team seed by region. It accounts for whether a team has lost and been knocked out of the tournament with a column called "team_alive". 

# Running the code

To run my code, one should press shift + enter in each cell from top to bottom or "run all" cells from the top.

# Contributing to the code

In the future, I'd love for someone to examine the impact of the region on forecasting by round. One could separate the data into the four regions (East, West, South, and Midwest) and look at team ratings and predictions. It would also be interesting to examine this data (2018) alongside data from previous years and examine how much the predictions change or alongside the outcomes of the tournament and how well they predicted the results.
