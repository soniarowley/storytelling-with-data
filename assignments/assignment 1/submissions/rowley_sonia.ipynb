    "This function passes two arguments: an integer x-coordinate and an integer y-coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this function returns the quadrant that the XY coordinates are located in. This part of the function uses an `if` / `elif` / `else` block and supports two input arguments. Its output is in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Point 1 lies in quadrant X.\n",
    "\n",
    "OR, if one of the coordinates == 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Point 1 lies on an axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part my function doesn't work. I tried to use a `while` loop and the `random.randint()` function to generate three random XY coordinates and return the quadrant of each. I expected this part of the function to lead to the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Point 2 is at (X1, Y1) \n",
    "    Point 2 lies in quadrant X.\n",
    "    Point 3 is at (X2, Y2)\n",

    "    Point 4 is at (X3, Y3)\n",

    "Instead, I just get:\n",
    "\n",
    "    None\n",
    "    \n",
    "The third part of my function also doesn't work. I created a list of four integers and created a `for` loop that should multiply each integer by 2. I expected the following outcome:\n",

    "Over the course of the last few days, I have been working my way through the Python 2 CodeAcademy course. I have also called a family member who has extensive coding experience and enjoys teaching. To help me \"get unstuck\" on this particular assignment, I referred back to my notes from the Python 2 CodeAcademy course I am making my way through and did a few google searches. The code below is the result of lots of (rather frustrating) experimentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few days, I spent approximately 10 hours on CodeAcademy and 5 hours on this assignment. As someone with no coding experience at all, I found it very difficult to know how to integrate the required elements of this function to create any sort of coherent output. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions I am left with**\n",
    "* Why is only the first part of my code working? It seems like the rest of the code isn't getting acted upon at all.\n",
    "* What kinds of _useful_ functions incorporate all of the required elements of this assignment? CodeAcademy has not yet introduced me to functions of more than about five lines. \n",
    "* What is the difference between `return` and `print`?\n",
    "* What are the key differences between Python 2 and Python 3 syntax?"
