    "    - the types of arguments the user needs to pass the if/elif/else function is to declare the variable of fav_food and give it a value. Then it needs 6 lines of code to pass the function and a print function to spit out the return value. Secondly, in order to pass the function of the for loop and while loop, the function must have a value also and variable declared.  \n",

    "    - The values of fav_food are supported by non-numerical variables and the same goes for the list. \n",
    "3. What the function does: \n",
    "    - The function is declaring my favorite food spam and saying which types of meals it is best in and declaring that this is greatest meal ever. This is a non-numerical function in which uses the if/elif/else, for, and while functions and loops. \n",
