# Assignment 1: Submission instructions

Your submission should comprise a single Jupyter (`.ipynb`) notebook named `<lastname>_<firstname>.ipynb`, added to this folder.

To submit your assignment, please do the following (after having run through the setup instructions in the [course introduction README file](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/README.md):
1. Pull the latest changes from the course repository into your fork: `git pull upstream master`
2. Add your notebook to the local copy of your fork: `git add <lastname>_<firstname>.ipynb`
3. Commit your changes to the local copy of your fork: `git commit -a -m "<brief message>"`
4. Push the changes to your fork to GitHub: `git push`
5. Open a pull request (from your fork's webpage: `https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/storytelling-with-data`) to pull your changes into the ContextLab fork of the course.  Your pull request should add a single file to the course repository (e.g. the "files changed" indicator should show a single file-- the notebook you added).
  - If you want to make any changes to your submission after submitting the pull request (prior to the assignment due date-- *start of class on April 1, 2019*), there is no need to close the pull request and re-open a new one.  Simply push your changes to your local fork and the pull request will be updated automatically.
